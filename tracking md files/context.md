## Session: 2026-05-31 — Repo bootstrap

### What was done
- Created The Forge repo at `/Volumes/Marc Working Drive/Development/The Forge/` from Starter Repo
- Wrote `claude.md` (Forge-specific SOPs, invariants, conditional triggers)
- Wrote `agents md files/agents.md` (architecture, subsystems, Firestore schema, data flow)
- Wrote `tracking md files/ARCHITECTURE.md` (full system architecture)
- Wrote `tracking md files/backlog.md` (§1–§11, prioritized, critical path defined)
- Wrote `backend.md` (Firebase + SwarmSpace reference)
- Wrote `tracking md files/FEATURES.md`, `UI_UX.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `planner.md`
- Copied all Starter Repo agent SOPs and bugtracker files
- Copied The Forge protocol docs (workflow_template.md, positioning_brief.md) into `DOCS/forge/`
- Initialized git and pushed to `https://github.com/marcyap29/theforge.git`

### Next
- Start §1: Firestore schema + `forge_project_repository.dart`
- Start Flutter project scaffold (`flutter create`)

### Warnings / open items
- Flutter project not yet created — repo is docs + config only at this stage
- Firebase project `arc-epi` shared with LUMARA + SwarmSpace — no new Firebase project needed
- SwarmSpace spec gen function does not exist yet — will need to add route to swarmspaceRouter or create standalone `generateSpec` function
